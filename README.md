# [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/)
Just a repo containing my solutions as I come up with them.

Each one is a separate binary in the package, and the inputs are in the `assets` directory.  Run them with cargo:
```bash
cargo run --bin d01p1 assets/d01/input
```
for instance, to run day 1's part 1 solution on the appropriate input.  Any text file can be specified as input.
